   <p>My hobby is dicovering electronic parts which I do in my free time.I stared when I was6 year old.Once a thought came to my mind thatwhat would be inside my remote control car?,how did it make such movements?.Then I opened the car with my screwdriver then i saw many small black,brown and yellow tiny square box like things, lines made of sillconor or copper.and 2 motors attached to the wheel . Then I saw a tiny cylender like thing whith ehith a steel wire.there were 7 resistor an 3 small led bulb. the most strange thing
     I saw was silver dots here and there.<br/> Whenever my elctronic toy stopped working or got damaed i opened it to observe what was inside it.I still like it as from that time Iwanted make things from it. </p>
